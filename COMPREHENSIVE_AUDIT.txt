SUMMARY:
========
Total node types in nodes.ts: 70

  - Phase-1 complete: 8 (Compute, Map, Normalize, Denormalize, Sample, Limit, Count, Assert)
  - Existing working: 8 (File/DB/Filter/Validate/Reject/Error/Reformat)
Missing executors: 54

PRIORITY IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:
=============================

TIER-1 (CRITICAL - Required for basic workflows):
--------------------------------------------------
1. Start                - Job entry point
2. End                  - Job completion
3. FailJob             - Explicit failure
4. Decision            - Conditional branching
5. Switch              - Multi-condition routing
6. Sort                - Dataset ordering
7. Aggregate           - Group-by + stats
8. SchemaValidator     - Input validation

TIER-2 (IMPORTANT - Enhances workflow capability):
--------------------------------------------------
9. Split               - Stream replication
10. Gather             - Stream merging
11. Partition          - Data distribution
12. Collect            - Partition collection
13. Merge              - Sorted stream merging
14. Deduplicate        - Duplicate removal
15. Rollup             - Hierarchical aggregation
16. Window             - Advanced analytics
17. Scan               - Running aggregates
18. Checkpoint         - State persistence

TIER-3 (NICE-TO-HAVE - Specialized features):
-----------------------------------------------
19-30. XML/JSON processing (XMLSplit, XMLParse, JSONFlatten, etc.)
31-40. REST/Web operations (RestAPISource, RestAPISink, WebServiceCall)
41-50. Script execution (PythonNode, ScriptNode, ShellNode)
51+. Kafka/Streaming, Encryption, Advanced lookups

IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY:
=========================

Phase-1 (DONE):
- Compute, Map, Normalize, Denormalize, Sample, Limit, Count, Assert

Phase-2 (RECOMMENDED NEXT):
- Control flow: Start, End, FailJob (required for executability)
- Routing: Decision, Switch, Split, Gather (enables complex workflows)
- Aggregation: Sort, Aggregate (common operations)
- Schema: SchemaValidator (data quality gate)

Phase-3 (DEFERRED):
- Advanced joins/lookups (complex multi-stream handling)
- XML/JSON processing (specialized domains)
- Kafka/streaming (infrastructure dependent)
- Script execution (security concerns)
- Encryption (cryptography complexity)

NOTES:
======
- All new executors follow NodeExecutor<I,O> pattern
- All validate config and fail fast
- All support metrics (supportsMetrics() = true)
- All support failure handling (supportsFailureHandling() = true)
- Multi-output nodes (Decision, Switch, Split) require engine routing support
- Stream merging nodes (Gather, Collect) require multi-input support
- Control nodes (Start, End) may interact with graph builder directly
